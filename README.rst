About
-----

isk-daemon is an open source database server capable of adding `content-based (visual) image searching
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content-based_image_retrieval>`_ to any image related website or software.

This technology allows users of any image-related website or software to sketch on a widget which image
they want to find and have the website reply to them the most similar images or simply request for more
similar photos at each image detail page.

A desktop version of this technology is available as the open-source
`imgSeek project <http://sourceforge.net/projects/imgseek/>`_

Key features
------------

* Query for images similar to one already indexed by the database, returning a similarity degree for the images on database that most resemble the target query image;

* Query for images similar to one described by its signature. A client-side widget may generate such signature from what a user sketched and submit it to the daemon;

* Network interface for easy integration with other web or desktop applications: XML-RPC, SOAP;

* Fast indexing of images one-by-one or in batch;

* Associate keywords to images and perform image-similarity queries filtering by keywords;

* Quickly remove images from database one-by-one or in batch;

* Built-in web-based admin interface with statistics and ad-hoc maintenance commands/API testing;

* Optimized image processing code (implemented in C++).

Install instructions
--------------------

Here is a quick guide to build from a cloned git repo. You may want to ``sudo`` all these commands if you
have permission errors.

I assume you know how to build from source and have all build tools (most are installed on the next steps)
and libraries installed for your system.

Ubuntu Quick Start
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This one is tested with Ubuntu 14.12

1. Install prerequisited if they're not on your system already:

    ``apt-get install swig ImageMagick libmagick++-dev python-dev``

2. cd to ./src and run: ``python setup.py install``

MacOS Quick Start
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Go to http://brew.sh and install ``Homebrew``

2. Install swig: ``brew install swig``

3. Install ImageMagick: ``brew install ImageMagick``

4. Install pkg-config: ``brew install pkg-config``

5. Cd to ./iskdaemon/src/ and run ``python setup.py install``

Alternatively, you can try it with ``macports``.
